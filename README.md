# Elm project starter

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [nix](https://nix.dev/) can be installed with [Determinate Nix Installer](https://determinate.systems/nix-installer/) for Linux, MacOs and WSL

### Setup & install instructions

- `nix develop` will place you into a bash environment with system dependencies
  - install node dependancies with `npm install`
  - install elm dependancies with `prep-elm-home` - this is patched to use [`lydell/elm-safe-virtual-dom`](https://github.com/lydell/elm-safe-virtual-dom/)
  - `npm run dev` to start a dev server on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
  - If you add new Elm dependancies run `elm2nix lock`, this creates hashes needed for the production build
  - pre-commit hooks are set up to format, test code and ensure elm deps are added to a lock file

### Build

- `nix build` generate a production build in `result/share/`

### Testing

We're using [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for Typescript. These tests can be colocated with the code they are testing and run using

```sh
npm run test:ts
```

We're using [elm-test-rs](https://github.com/mpizenberg/elm-test-rs) to run [elm tests](https://github.com/elm-explorations/test/). Tests for Elm code must live in `./tests` and can be run using

```sh
elm-test-rs
```
